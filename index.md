Manifolds crop up everywhere in mathematics. These generalizations of curves and
surfaces to arbitrarily many dimensions provide the mathematical context for understanding
“space” in all of its manifestations. Today, the tools of manifold theory
are indispensable in most major subfields of pure mathematics, and are becoming
increasingly important in such diverse fields as genetics, robotics, econometrics,
statistics, computer graphics, biomedical imaging, and, of course, the undisputed
leader among consumers (and inspirers) of mathematics—theoretical physics. No
longer the province of differential geometers alone, smooth manifold technology is
now a basic skill that all mathematics students should acquire as early as possible.
Over the past century or two, mathematicians have developed a wondrous collection
of conceptual machines that enable us to peer ever more deeply into the invisible
world of geometry in higher dimensions. Once their operation is mastered, these
powerful machines enable us to think geometrically about the 6-dimensional solution
set of a polynomial equation in four complex variables, or the 10-dimensional
manifold of 5  5 orthogonal matrices, as easily as we think about the familiar
2-dimensional sphere in R3. The price we pay for this power, however, is that the
machines are assembled from layer upon layer of abstract structure. Starting with the
familiar raw materials of Euclidean spaces, linear algebra, multivariable calculus,
and differential equations, one must progress through topological spaces, smooth atlases,
tangent bundles, immersed and embedded submanifolds, vector fields, flows,
cotangent bundles, tensors, Riemannian metrics, differential forms, foliations, Lie
derivatives, Lie groups, Lie algebras, and more—just to get to the point where one
can even think about studying specialized applications of manifold theory such as
comparison theory, gauge theory, symplectic topology, or Ricci flow.
This book is designed as a first-year graduate text on manifold theory, for students
who already have a solid acquaintance with undergraduate linear algebra, real
analysis, and topology. I have tried to focus on the portions of manifold theory that
will be needed by most people who go on to use manifolds in mathematical or scientific
research. I introduce and use all of the standard tools of the subject, and
prove most of its fundamental theorems, while avoiding unnecessary generalization
